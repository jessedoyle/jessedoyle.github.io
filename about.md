_**Hi, I'm Jesse Doyle!**_ I'm from the [Edmonton, Alberta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton) area and I have a passion for all things involving code.

I graduated from the University of Alberta with distinction in 2013 and received a BSc in Computing Science. Currently, I'm a developer on the web team at the [Alberta Motor Association](https://ama.ab.ca). In the past, I've worked as a freelance Rails Developer creating custom web applications that make people's lives easier.

In school, I dabbled in many programming languages such as Java, C, Scheme and Prolog, but I've grown to *love* the simplicity of Ruby. I'm also extremely interested in the [Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org) programming language due to its Ruby heritage.

I love contributing to open-source projects. I've contributed to many projects, including the following:

* [Prawn](https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn) - A Ruby PDF generation library.
* [Crystal](https://github.com/manastech/crystal) - A programming language inspired by Ruby.
* [TTFunk](https://github.com/prawnpdf/ttfunk) - An all-ruby TTF font parser.
* [Asciidoctor-PDF](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf) - PDF backend for the [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org) project.

In my free time I enjoy travelling, hiking, and constantly improving my development skills by reading source code or hacking on a side project.

If you wish to see some of the things I've created, head on over to the [projects]({{ site.basedir }}/projects/) page or [view my résumé](https://github.com/jessedoyle/resume/raw/master/output/template.pdf).
